                </div>

                <p>From the 2004-05 season until today, teams in the NBA have experienced a huge increase in the number
                    of
                    three-pointers taken per game. It happened because of an analytics revolution which really proved
                    three-pointers were far more efficient than shots from mid-range.</p>

                <p>Players like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, of the Golden State Warriors have managed to win
                    championships by shooting triples in high volume. Other rule changes, like calling hand-checking
                    closer,
                    have also benefited perimeter shooting. The emphasis on spacing and pace has made the three-point
                    shot a
                    fundamental weapon.</p>

                <p>Finally, today's younger players often train from an early age in three-point
                    shooting, meaning there are big men who can shoot from three. As a result, the league-wide average
                    of
                    three-point attempts per game surged-from just 16.8 in 2004-05 to more than 34 in recent seasons.
                    The
                    trend continues to shape the modern game with the three-pointer as perhaps the most dominant shot in
                    today's NBA.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading">League Points Per Game Over The Years</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Over the course of the 2004-05 season, the NBA experienced a great league-wide surge in scoring; namely,
                points per game rose due to various factors. The average team in 2004-05 scored approximately
                97.2 points per game. By recent seasons, that number has exceeded 114 PPG, marking a major shift in
                offensive efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>Several key reasons explain this trend. The NBA's rule changes, particularly the crackdown on
                hand-checking and more stringent calls for defensive three-second violations have made it easier
                for offenses to get easy baskets. Meanwhile, analytics have persuaded teams to take
                more efficient shots—either three-pointers or attempts near the rim—while reducing inefficient
                mid-range shots.
            </p>

            <p>Quickening up the pace of play had also played a part in the scoring boom. Teams now focus on fast
                possessions, transition offense, and spacing, leading to more scoring opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>As a result, the NBA has become an offense-first league, with higher PPG averages than in previous
                decades. With continued innovation in strategy and player development, scoring numbers may continue
                to rise in the years to come.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Since the 2004-05 NBA season, the number of field goal attempts (FGA) per game has seen a steady
                    increase, reflecting the league's shift toward a faster-paced, high-scoring style of play. In
                    2004-05, the combined FGA per game for both teams was around 160.7. In recent seasons, that number
                    has climbed to over 180 FGA per game, marking a significant uptick in shot volume.</p>

                <p>This rise is largely driven by the emphasis on offensive efficiency and pace. The decline of
                    isolation-heavy offenses and the increase in transition play have led to more possessions per game,
                    resulting in higher shot attempts. Additionally, the widespread adoption of analytics has encouraged
                    teams to take quick, high-value shots—particularly three-pointers and shots at the rim—rather than
                    slowing the game down with mid-range attempts.</p>

                <p>Rule changes, including the enforcement of defensive three-second violations and the reduction of
                    hand-checking, have also played a role in increasing offensive freedom. With teams prioritizing
                    spacing, ball movement, and fast breaks, the game has become more fluid and dynamic.</p>

                <p>As a result, the modern NBA is characterized by a higher volume of shot attempts, contributing to
                    the league-wide surge in scoring. This trend shows no signs of slowing down, as teams continue to
                    push the boundaries of offensive efficiency and tempo.
